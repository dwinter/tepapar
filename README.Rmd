This is a stem of a project on working with the [Te Papa collections
API](https://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2018/08/30/make-cool-stuff-with-our-collections-using-our-api/) from
within R. At the moment it only includes some basic functions to generate user
keys and make simple requests. If you'd like to help make it better please do
so!



## Example

At present teh onyl 'high-level' function is `tp_taxon` which is for searching
for taxonomy records:

```{r example}
tiny_snails <- tp_taxon("allodiscus")
tiny_snails
```

As the printed information suggests, the `results` object contains information
on all of these matches

```{r}
head(tiny_snails$results,3)
```
